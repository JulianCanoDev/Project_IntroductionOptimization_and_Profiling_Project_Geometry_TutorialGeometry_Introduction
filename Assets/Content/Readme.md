Arm & Unity: 3D Art Optimization for Mobile Gaming
==================================================

This project contains four sample demos for the Unity Learn course found at https://learn.unity.com/course/3d-art-optimization-for-mobile-gaming-5474 

Open, run, and profile each demo in this provided custom view containing the Frame Debugger and Unity Profiler.  As you find potential bottlenecks in each demo, you are encouraged to apply optimizations you have learned about in the course - whether in-editor or in your chosen 3D modeling software - to the art assets provided!

(This demo was created with Unity 2019.4.10f1 LTS)
